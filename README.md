# Workday Scheduler
This simple calendar will allow user to save events for each our of the day. 

# Purpose
The homework assignment will test my ability to use HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Moment.js

The scheduler should:
* Display the current day and time when opened.
* Each time block should be color coded to show whether it is in the past, present or future.
* I should be able to enter an event in a timeblock.
* When the saved button is clicked, the event information should be saved to local storage.
* When I refresh the page the saved events will remain.
